# Presenting... RecetaYa!

_*Have you ever wanted to cook something nice on a student budget?*_  

_*Ever looked up a recipe and realized you’re missing ingredients?*_

**RecetaYa** is a project designed to help people decide what to cook based on the ingredients they already have at home.  
It focuses on a very common situation: having food available but not knowing what recipes can be made with it. :>

## 💭 Project Idea

Many people have ingredients in their fridge or pantry but don’t know what recipes they can prepare with them.  
This often leads to food waste, time wasted searching for recipes, and frustration when cooking.

RecetaYa aims to simplify this process by suggesting meals based on what the user already has.
